## Resistance
Start up a bayesian network of beliefs and update it based on votes and missions.

What are your beliefs?
- Whether someone is a spy or not

How do you decide?
We will take a trust-based approach. We first assume everyone is trustworthy, and deduct points as they are less trustworthy.
- Mission results
  - If a mission fails...
    - The person who proposed it is suspect (somewhat)
    - The people who voted for it are suspect (a little)
    - The people in it are suspect (a lot)
